Module 4 Challenge

PyCitySchool.ipynb merges the schools_complete and students_complete CSV files into one dataframe and uses that to calculate the stats for the different districts in another datafram called district_summary. The data is further broken down by school and used to create the per_school_summary dataframe. From there the best and worst performing schools by passing percentage are displayed. The different schools are then further analyzed to see the average scores for grades 9 through 12. The school spending per student is then compared against the average scores for the different schools in the dataframe spending_summary. The schools' average grades are compared against their size in size_summary. The type of school is compared against the averge scores in type summary.


It seems that Charter schools do much better than District schools with 90% of Charter schools passing and only 53% of District schools passing. For size comparison Small and Medium schools seem to score about the same, but Large schools score worse.
